First promt:

Hi chatgpt!
I would like you to work with me on a small project exploring "dandy numbers".

Here is the definition of "dandy numbers". Let i be an integer greater or equal to 10.
Then i is called a "dandy" number (or just "dandy") if the last digit of i is strictly larger
than the first digit of i using decimal representation.

Here a few examples:
a) The number 10 is not a dandy number, as the lart digit "0" is smaller than the first digit "1".
b) The number 6238 is dandy, since the last digit 8 is larger than the first digit 6.
c) The number 8999999 is dandy since 9 is larger than 8.

Our final goal is to get a python function that, given a dandy number d1, calculates the next largest dandy number d2.

To achieve that goal, you should use the following strategy.

1) Firstly, create some examples for dandy numbers by yourself.

2) Secondly, given your examples, infer some true assertions about dandy number. Those may include the folliwng. 
What is the smallest dandy number, what is the largest one? 
What is the distance between a dandy number d1 and the next larger dandy number d2?
Consider corner cases for those questions. How many dandy numbers are there?
If helpful, create some additional examples to convince yourself of the patterns you found in dandy numbers.

3) Using the insights you made in step 2. Create a python function called "next_dandy" which calculates the next larger dandy number d2, 
given a dandy number d1. The function "next_dandy" must not simply try all successors of d1, instead the next dandy number should be deduced constructively.
Here an example of what constructively means: Given the number dandy number 89, the following two digits numbers cannot be dandy, since they start with 9 and there is no digit larger than 9.
Hence the next dandy must be three digit. As the smallest three digits number start with a 1, like 100, 101, 102, 103, the number 102 is the next largest dandy number after 89.

This function should be well written and commented using standard python packages. You may write auxiliary function, 
if you find this helpful. It is very important that you correctly consider corner cases in this function.

4.) Given the function "next_dandy" fron step 3, please test it on some examples. That means apply a function to a dandy number d1 and check whether
the fucntion return d2 is indeed the next larger dandy number. Check 3 at least examples.

5.) If, in step 4 you found, that the function "next_dandy" is not correct, write a new function "next_dandy" that incorporates improvement and/or corrections.

6.) When you created a new function in step 5, now test the new function on some examples. Remember, that corner cases are important.

7.) Iterate step 5.) and 6.) as long as you see fit, to improve the function "next_dandy" and the auxiliary functions if you use them.

8.) Provide your answer consisting of the entire python code in one script with header and comments. Further provide a summary of your insights on dandy numbers.


Second promt:

Dear chatgpt! That is a good start, unfortunately there are several mistakes in your answer. Let's go through them in the same oder as given in my initial promt.
